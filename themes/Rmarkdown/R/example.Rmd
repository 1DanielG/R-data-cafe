## Introduction R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can output the result of the code block without displaying the code itself. A chunck without code looks like this:
```{r cars_without_code, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Load libraries

It is possible to load libraries without displaying them in your document. The code below is hidden.

```{r test, include=FALSE}

library("MASS")
library("zoo")
```

## Inline code

Inline code execution is possible with a slightly different syntax. An example is: The average distance is `r mean(cars$dist)` and the average speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can define the size of plots, for example:

```{r cars_plot, fig.width=4, fig.height=5, fig.cap="resized image", echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
