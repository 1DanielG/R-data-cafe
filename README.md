# R data café 

This repository contains additional material for the R data café (Utrecht
University). There are *exercises* and *tips and tricks*. More exercises will
follow later.

A good website with a lot of exercises is http://r4ds.had.co.nz/. This website 
makes use of tidyverse, a very popular framework voor data handling in R.
