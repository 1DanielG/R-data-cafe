# R data café 

The R Data Cafe is a community event for R users of the Utrecht University. The goal 
of the event is to share knowledge about R and help researchers with programming
problems. The two hours during event is held every month and is open without 
registration.

This repository contains additional material for the R data café. There are several 
exercises and tips in the [exercises folder](/exercises/). A good website with a lot
of exercises is http://r4ds.had.co.nz/. This website makes use of tidyverse, a very
popular framework for data handling in R.

During each event, an R user demonstrates an interesting package or application of R. 
The additional material for the demonstrations can be found in the [themes folder](/themes/).
